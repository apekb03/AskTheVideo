# AskTheVideo

This project combines OpenAI Whisper for video transcription, LangChain for vector embedding and semantic search, and an LLM to generate accurate, context-aware responses.
The queries are at the end of the file, and they range from simple questions like "what is the videoa about" to specific questions like "divide  this polynomial".
