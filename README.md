# AskTheVideo
This project generates a transcript from a YouTube video using OpenAI's Whisper model. 
The transcript is then processed with LangChain to create vector embeddingsâ€”allowing for semantic similarity search and question answering.  
After embedding the transcript, I built a simple chatbot that can answer user queries about the video. 
The questions are kept intentionally simple to reduce the chances of hallucination and ensure accurate responses.
