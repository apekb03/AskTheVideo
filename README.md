VectorVision is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that allows users to ask natural language questions about video content and receive intelligent, grounded answers based on the video's transcript.

VectorVision converts video files into text, chunks and embeds the transcript, stores it in a vector database, and uses semantic similarity to retrieve the most relevant content when a question is asked. This retrieved content is then passed to an LLM (like GPT-4) to generate an accurate and context-aware answer.
